        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          Elon Musk's school days were challenging, as he faced bullying and
          even ended up hospitalized after being beaten by bullies who threw him
          down a set of stairs. This incident reportedly occurred after Musk
          made insensitive comments to a classmate. Musk has mentioned feeling
          out of sync with his classmates and has spoken about the social
          challenges he faced, stating that social cues were not intuitive for
          him. In 2021, he revealed that he has Asperger's syndrome during his
          appearance on "Saturday Night Live."
        </p>
        <p>
          During his childhood, Musk developed a passion for reading and coding,
          dedicating many late nights to these activities. At the age of 17, he
          achieved an exceptional score on a university-level aptitude test for
          computer programming skills. After graduating from high school, he
          moved to Canada with his family and studied at Queen's University in
          Ontario before completing his education at the University of
          Pennsylvania, earning degrees in physics and economics.
        </p>
        <p>
          While at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk and a classmate
          transformed a 10-bedroom frat house into a nightclub, showcasing one
          of his early entrepreneurial endeavors. After completing his
          undergraduate studies, Musk briefly pursued a Ph.D. at Stanford
          University but left after only two days to seize opportunities during
          the emerging dot-com boom. He never returned to Stanford to complete
          his doctoral program.

        <h2>A Journey of Innovation and Ambition</h2>

        <p>
          Driven by the belief that humanity must become a multiplanetary
          species, Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 to develop more affordable
          rockets. The company successfully launched the Falcon 1 in 2006,
          followed by the Falcon 9 in 2010. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, launched in
          2018, was designed to carry significantly more payload than its
          competitors at a lower cost. Musk introduced the Super Heavy-Starship
          system as the successor to the Falcon rockets, aiming to enable fast
          transportation on Earth and establish bases on the Moon and Mars.
          SpaceX also created the Dragon spacecraft, which transports supplies
          and astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). In 2020,
          Dragon completed a crewed flight to the ISS with NASA astronauts on
          board. SpaceX conducted test flights of the Super Heavy-Starship
          system in 2020, and Musk played a key role as CEO and chief designer
          in the development of Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Starship. The
          company is contracted by NASA to build the lunar lander for the
          Artemis space program, with a target date of 2025 for astronauts to
          return to the Moon.

        <h2>Revolutionizing Electric Cars and Proposing the Hyperloop</h2>

        <p>
          Elon Musk's interest in electric cars led him to become a major funder
          of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla) in 2004. Tesla introduced its
          first car, the Roadster, in 2006, which was a high-performance
          electric sports car capable of traveling 245 miles on a single charge.
          Tesla's innovative approach to electric vehicles challenged the
          perception of them being dull and unexciting. The company went public
          in 2010, raising around $226 million, and continued to make waves in
          the automotive industry with the introduction of the acclaimed Model S
          sedan in 2012, followed by the Model X luxury SUV in 2015. In 2017,
          Tesla started production of the more affordable Model 3, which became
          the best-selling electric car of all time. In 2013, dissatisfied with
          the projected cost of a high-speed rail system in California, Musk
          proposed an alternative concept called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop
          was envisioned as a high-speed transportation system where passenger
          pods would travel through pneumatic tubes, enabling rapid travel
          between Los Angeles and San Francisco in just 35 minutes at speeds
          close to the speed of sound. Musk estimated the Hyperloop's cost to be
          significantly lower than the proposed rail system, but due to his
          commitments with SpaceX and Tesla, he was unable to personally pursue
          its development.
        </p>
        <h2>From Controversial Tweets to a Bid for Twitter Ownership</h2>

        <p>
          Elon Musk joined Twitter in 2009 and quickly gained a massive
          following, with over 85 million followers by 2022. In 2018, he tweeted
          about potentially taking Tesla private at a value of $420 per share,
          which led to legal issues. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
          (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, resulting in a settlement where
          he stepped down as Tesla's chairman for three years, but remained CEO.
          Musk expressed criticism towards Twitter's content moderation policies
          and in 2022, he made a bid to acquire the entire company. Initially
          accepted, Musk later withdrew his bid, claiming Twitter had breached
          the purchase agreement. Twitter sued Musk, and ultimately, its
          shareholders voted to accept his offer, leading to the completion of
          the deal in October 2022.
        </p>

        <h2>OpenAI</h2>
        <p>
          In 2015, Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit organization focused
          on researching artificial intelligence and ensuring its safe and
          beneficial development. However, he stepped down from the board later
          to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Tesla, which was making
          advancements in AI for its self-driving car technology. Despite this,
          Musk has expressed criticism towards OpenAI and is now working on
          launching his own AI competitor, playfully named "Truth GPT,"
          following the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. During the same period,
          SpaceX, under Musk's leadership, achieved significant milestones,
          including 24 launches by the end of 2015. These launches included
          tasks such as resupplying the International Space Station and breaking
          records in the process. In 2015, Tesla also introduced its initial
          version of Autopilot, a driver-assist feature for its electric
          vehicles (EVs). Over the years, Musk continued to enhance this
          technology, eventually releasing an upgraded version called Full
          Self-Driving beta.
